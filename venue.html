            Tyninghame is a tiny village in East Lothian, about 45 minutes outside Edinburgh. We chose their Village Hall as our wedding venue after discovering it by chance, on a drive out to the excellent <a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/tantallon-castle/" target="_blank">Tantallon Castle</a>. We knew it was the kind of place we could make our own.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://tyninghamevillagehall.org.uk/" target="_blank">Tyninghame Village Hall</a> sits in the middle of a short residential street with some lovely cottages and a wee coffee shop opposite. At the back, it opens into fields, where we hope to have our ceremony. After 9pm, please respect the village residents if you’re outside - the fire escape opens into one of their gardens…
          </p>
          <p>
            There are no public transport connections out to Tyninghame, but you can travel to and from the venue on our chartered bus, by taxi or your own car. Parking should be available on street. We will confirm bus times and locations nearer the day, but they will leave at approximately 1.30pm from Princes St and 1.45pm from Leith.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, as a tiny wee place, there are no ATMs in the village. The bar will take card, signal permitting, but please bring cash if you can. A pint of beer or a large glass of wine are priced at £5.
          </p>
